## Intro

This folder contains all codes used for the paper: Thatâ€™s what she said: An Empirical Investigation on the Gender Gap in Inflation Expectations

All codes are written by Lovisa Reiche.

## Master

The paper can be replicated by running master.R
It requires that all datasets are saved in 0_data/external in sub-folders named according to each survey (BOP-HH, FRBNY, Michigan, ECFIN)

## Individual replications

Individual parts of the paper can be replicated as follows:

# Notes

Dataformat requires preBOP and preSCE to be run prior to any analysis.

It is recommended to always run all codes of one track (compsur, finlit or hhrole)

Figures are computed in separate overleaf projects but codes show how data ius computed.
